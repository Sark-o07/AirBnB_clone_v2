# Web Flask

This sub-project, undertaken at AirBnB, marked my initial foray into working with Flask and Jinja2. The primary objective was to integrate the back-end storage engine with previously developed static HTML/CSS pages for the web application.

## Project Overview

- **Introduction to Flask:**
  - Files 0 to 6 encompass introductory tasks aimed at acquainting myself with the basics of Flask.

- **Jinja Templates:**
  - Starting from File 7 onwards, the project progressively involved the development of more complex Jinja templates. These templates were designed to align with the structure and content of the HBnB (HomeBnB) HTML pages.
